      About Me
      <div className="text-xl text-light-blue-100 font-semibold pr-8 fl">
        My name is Youssef, 20 years old. I'm a third-year computer science student
        at the GIUAS (German Internaional University of Applied Sciences).
        Throughout my CS education, I have been working on projects that are web-based
        as well as system-based. I have a passion for software development and I'm
        always looking for new ways to improve my skills. Currently, I am proficient in
        the following languages:
        <div className=" text-dark-blue-100 inline">
          &nbsp;JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, C, C++, Java, and SQL.&nbsp;
        </div>
        
          My hobbies include:
          <div className=" text-dark-blue-100 inline">
            &nbsp;playing PC games, programming, music and binge-watching Criminal Minds.&nbsp;
          </div>
        
      </div>
    </div>
